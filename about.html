        <h2>Welcome to the History of Family Portraits</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a tribute to the evolution of family portraits through the decades. From the formal, black-and-white images of the 1930s to the vibrant and candid photographs of the 2020s, each era tells a unique story of culture, technology, and family life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this site is to explore how the tradition of family portraits has changed over time, reflecting shifts in societal values, economic conditions, and technological advancements. Whether you're a history enthusiast, a photography lover, or simply curious about the past, we hope this journey through family portraiture inspires and informs.
